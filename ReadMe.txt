This repo is an example of how I was able to directly communicate with an Arduino board which was part of an automated test system directly thought the USB comm port. Using an FTDI cable I was able to connect a USB cable to the PC and also to an arduino.
This project is an example of how I did this.

This folder contains the project files for the SerialComms.exe which gets run by the DCM Test Suite GUI (Automated Test Suite for an Automated door controller from a pervious job).
No information about the product from that company is included in this repo.

To edit this .exe open 'SerialCommsC.sln' in Visual Studio.

If you navigate to "$/Firmware/Tools/DCM Test Suite/SerialComms/x64/Release" you will find the compiled .exe file.
